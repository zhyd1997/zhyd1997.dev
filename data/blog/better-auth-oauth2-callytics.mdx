summary: 'How Better Auth simplifies OAuth 2.0 integration in Next.js, eliminating the pain of manual callback and refresh token logic—featuring my Cal.com OAuth integration in Callytics.'
---

In my previous work experience, integrating OAuth 2.0 for Meta (including Facebook and Instagram) and Outlook was a headache—requiring manual implementation of callbacks and refresh token logic.

Now, in the same Next.js environment, integrating Cal.com OAuth 2.0 in my Callytics project was effortless with Better Auth.

## 🚨 The Old Way: Manual OAuth Pain

Previously, when integrating OAuth providers like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Outlook, I had to:

- Manually handle OAuth callbacks
- Write custom logic for access token acquisition
- Implement refresh token mechanisms from scratch
- Deal with token expiration edge cases

This approach was:

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Difficult to maintain
- Required deep understanding of OAuth 2.0 specs

## ✅ The Better Auth Way: Simplified OAuth in Callytics

When integrating Cal.com OAuth 2.0 in my Callytics project using Better Auth, the experience was dramatically different:

### Auto-Generated Prisma Schema

Better Auth automatically generates the necessary Prisma schema for OAuth integration. No need to manually design database tables for:

- User accounts
- OAuth sessions
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens

### Automatic Callback Handling

The callback endpoint is handled automatically by Better Auth—no custom route handlers needed.

### Auto Refresh Access Token Mechanism

Better Auth includes a sophisticated auto-refresh mechanism. Looking at the source code at [`packages/core/src/oauth2/refresh-access-token.ts` (lines 108-123)](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/oauth2/refresh-access-token.ts#L108-L123), the library intelligently:

- Monitors token expiration
- Automatically refreshes access tokens before they expire
- Handles refresh token rotation
- Manages error scenarios gracefully

This means **no more manual token refresh logic**—it just works!

## 🔧 Fixing the Cal.com OAuth Token Expiration Issue

While integrating Cal.com OAuth in Callytics, I discovered that users had to re-authenticate every 30 minutes. This was frustrating for the user experience.

After investigating, I found that Cal.com's OAuth token endpoint wasn't fully RFC 6749 compliant. It wasn't returning:

- `token_type` (should be "bearer")
- `expires_in` (token expiration time in seconds)

Without `expires_in`, Better Auth (and other OAuth clients) couldn't determine when to refresh the token, leading to frequent re-authentication.

### The Fix: PR #24841

I submitted [PR #24841](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/24841) to fix this issue:

**What changed:**

- Added `token_type: "bearer"` to the token response
- Added `expires_in: 1800` (30 minutes in seconds)
- Added proper cache headers (`Cache-Control: no-store`)

**Result:**

- Better Auth can now properly detect token expiration
- Automatic token refresh works seamlessly
- No more re-authentication every 30 minutes!
- Full RFC 6749 compliance

## 💡 Key Benefits of Better Auth

**Good DX (Developer Experience)!**

1. **Auto-generated schemas** - No manual database design
2. **Built-in callback handling** - No custom route logic
3. **Automatic token refresh** - No manual refresh logic
4. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support
5. **Next.js optimized** - Works seamlessly with App Router and Server Components

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Manual OAuth):

```typescript
// Manual callback handler
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const code = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('code')
  // Exchange code for token
  // Store tokens in database
  // Set up refresh logic
  // Handle errors
  // ... 50+ lines of code
}

// Manual refresh token logic
async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string) {
  // Make refresh request
  // Update database
  // Handle expiration
  // ... 30+ lines of code
}
```

### After (Better Auth):

```typescript
// In better-auth config
export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    calcom: {
      clientId: process.env.CALCOM_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.CALCOM_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
  },
})

// That's it! Callback and refresh handled automatically
```

## 🚀 Conclusion

Better Auth transforms OAuth 2.0 integration from a tedious, error-prone task into a simple configuration step. By handling callbacks, token management, and refresh logic automatically, it lets developers focus on building features instead of wrestling with OAuth specifications.

If you're building a Next.js application that needs OAuth integration, I highly recommend trying Better Auth. The DX is truly better.
