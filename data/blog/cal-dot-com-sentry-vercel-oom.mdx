title: 'How I Helped the Cal.com Team Resolve a Sentry Integration That Crashed Vercel Builds'

summary: While helping the Cal.com team, I resolved a critical issue where Sentryâ€™s Next.js integration caused Vercel builds to run out of memory. The root cause was the `withSentryConfig()` wrapper bloating server-side output during build. By removing it and replacing it with a lightweight `@sentry/cli` script for client-side source maps, we restored stable, fast, and memory-efficient buildsâ€”without losing Sentryâ€™s error tracking.

While contributing to [the Cal.com open source project](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pull/21108), I helped the team debug a serious issue: Vercel deployments were failing with Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors. This was caused by how we integrated Sentry into the Next.js project.

In this post, Iâ€™ll explain the problem, its root cause, and how we solved it by decoupling build-time instrumentation from release-time asset management.

ðŸš¨ The Problem: OOM on Vercel

Vercel builds were crashing with OOM.
> Vercelâ€™s build environment is capped at **2 CPUs** and **8 GB RAM**

Attempts to fix it using:
```js
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=6144" // 75% of Vercel RAM
```
did not work

The root cause was **oversized server-side output files** will exhaust CPU and RAM resources when generating source maps and be processed by Sentry.

The largest file size under `.next` folder is 5.6 MB.

------

There're 3 runtimes for Nextjs: `nodejs`, `edge` and `client`.

The `@sentry/nextjs` SDK provides a `withSentryConfig()` function, which wraps your `next.config.js` to inject:
- Webpack plugins
- Module rules
- Debug ID handling
- Runtime wrapping logic

This logic applies to **all runtimes** and inflates the size of server-side bundles. In our case, some files became large enough to trigger OOM crashes during Vercel builds.

------

âœ… The Fix

We refactored the Sentry integration by splitting concerns between runtime instrumentation and release asset management.

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Remove `withSentryConfig()` From `next.config.js`

Before:
```js
// next.config.js
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/nextjs');

module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  // your config
});
```
After
```js
module.exports = {
  // plain Next.js config
};
```

This prevents Sentry from modifying the Webpack config and drastically reduces memory usage during builds.

We kept runtime Sentry setup (e.g., in `_app.tsx` and API routes) to continue error reporting.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Use `@sentry/cli` in a custom script

Instead of letting the SDK manage releases, we handled them manually with sentry-cli.

We created a script create-sentry-release.js and wired it to yarn sentry:release.

```json
# package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sentry:release": "node scripts/create-sentry-release.js"
  }
}
```

```js
// scripts/create-sentry-release.js
const { execSync } = require("child_process");

const CLIENT_FILES_PATH = ".next/static/chunks";

try {
  const release = execSync("git rev-parse HEAD").toString().trim();

  execSync(`sentry-cli releases new ${release}`, { stdio: "inherit" });
  execSync(`sentry-cli releases set-commits ${release} --auto`, { stdio: "inherit" });
  execSync(`sentry-cli sourcemaps inject ${CLIENT_FILES_PATH}`, { stdio: "inherit" });
  execSync(
    `sentry-cli sourcemaps upload ${CLIENT_FILES_PATH} --validate --ext=js --ext=map --release=${release}`,
    {
      stdio: "inherit",
      env: process.env,
    }
  );
  execSync(`sentry-cli releases finalize ${release}`, { stdio: "inherit" });
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Sentry CLI execution failed:", err);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

This script:
1. Gets the current Git SHA
2. Creates a Sentry release
3. Injects Debug IDs into the client files
4. Uploads source maps with validation
5. Finalizes the release

All without touching the server or edge bundles.

ðŸ”„ Final Build Flow

```shell
# Step 1: Build your app
yarn build

# Step 2: Release to Sentry (client-side only)
yarn sentry:release
```

This kept our builds fast, stable, and under memory limits.

âœ… Results

| Metric         | Impact     | Status |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Memory usage   | + ~3%        | ðŸ”º     |
| Build time     | + ~1 min     | ðŸ”º     |
| Disk usage     | + ~0%        | âœ…     |


ðŸ’¡ Takeaways
- Avoid using `withSentryConfig()` on memory-constrained CI/CD environments and large Nextjs app codebase
- Use `@sentry/cli` to manage releases manually
- Split your `build` and `release` steps for better control and performance
- Keep runtime error tracking without impacting the build phase
